# PostgreSQL
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These credentials are used by both the postgres container (to create the database
# and user) and the django container (to connect to the database).
#
# POSTGRES_HOST is the Docker network hostname. In Docker Compose, containers
# communicate via service names, so "postgres" refers to the postgres container.
#
# DATABASE_URL is automatically constructed by the entrypoint script from these
# variables, so you don't need to set it manually.
#
# For local development, you can use simple credentials like shown below.
# For production, use strong randomly-generated passwords.

POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=validibot
POSTGRES_USER=validibot
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=validibot
