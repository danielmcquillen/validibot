# PostgreSQL (Docker Compose Production)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file to .envs/.production/.docker-compose/.postgres
#
# These credentials are used by both the postgres container (to create the database
# and user on first run) and the django container (to connect to the database).
#
# DATABASE_URL is automatically constructed by the entrypoint script from these
# variables, so you don't need to set it manually.
#
# IMPORTANT: Change the password before deploying to production!
# Use a strong, randomly-generated password (at least 32 characters).
#
# Example to generate a password:
#   python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'
