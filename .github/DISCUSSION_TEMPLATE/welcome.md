### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

We welcome bug reports and feature suggestions! Please use:

- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/danielmcquillen/validibot/issues)** for bug reports
- **[Ideas category](https://github.com/danielmcquillen/validibot/discussions/categories/ideas)** in Discussions for feature requests

### Code Contributions

We are **not currently accepting unsolicited pull requests**. Validibot is maintained by a small team and we need to keep the codebase manageable.

If you'd like to contribute code:

1. **Open an issue first** describing what you'd like to change
2. **Wait for approval** before writing any code
3. We may implement the feature ourselves, or invite you to submit a PR

This helps us avoid duplicate work and ensures contributions align with our roadmap.

### Validator Contributions

We're more open to contributions for **[validibot-validators](https://github.com/danielmcquillen/validibot-validators)** (MIT licensed). If you've built a custom validator that might benefit others, open an issue to discuss adding it.
