"Licensor").

Contributor by preserving their rights in those Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the
products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this
definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited
to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to
Us. If You are making a Contribution on behalf of an entity, "You" also
refers to that entity, and You represent that You are authorised to bind
that entity to this Agreement.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
Contributions and such derivative works.

---

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by
Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the
Work to which such Contribution was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your
Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Right to Grant Licenses

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses;

(b) If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create
that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received
permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your
employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your
employer has executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement
with Us;

(c) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 6
for submissions on behalf of others); and

(d) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which
are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

---

## 5. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in any
project or source repository is entirely at Our discretion. You further
understand that this Agreement does not create an obligation for Us to use
Your Contribution.

---

## 6. Submissions on Behalf of Others

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to Us separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete
details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including,
but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of
which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
"Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]."

---

## 7. Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, any moral rights You may have in or relating to Your
Contributions, to the extent necessary to allow Us to exercise the rights
granted in Section 2.

---

## 8. Our Use of Contributions

You acknowledge and agree that We may use Your Contributions under any
license, including but not limited to:

(a) The GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0);

(b) Any commercial license that We offer to Our customers; and

(c) Any future license that We may adopt for the Work.

This includes the right to relicense Your Contributions as part of the
Work under different terms, including proprietary commercial terms. This
is essential for Our dual-licensing model, where the Work is available
under both an open source license and commercial licenses.
