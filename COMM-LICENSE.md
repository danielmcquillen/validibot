## 2. LICENSE GRANT

2.1 **Grant of License.** Subject to the terms of this Agreement and payment of
the applicable Subscription Fee, Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, limited license to:

   (a) Install and use the Software on an unlimited number of Hosts controlled
   by Licensee;

   (b) Allow an unlimited number of Authorised Users to access and use the
   Software;

   (c) Modify the Software for Licensee's own internal use, provided that such
   modifications are not distributed to third parties;

   (d) Make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for archival and
   backup purposes; and

   (e) Use the Documentation in connection with permitted use of the Software.

2.2 **License Restrictions.** Licensee shall not:

   (a) Sublicense, sell, lease, rent, loan, or otherwise transfer the Software
   or any rights therein to any third party;

   (b) Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on
   the Software or Documentation;

   (c) Use the Software to provide managed services to unaffiliated third
   parties where the primary value delivered is access to the Software itself
   (if Licensee wishes to distribute the Software as part of a product sold to
   Licensee's own customers, Licensee must contact licensing@validibot.com to
   negotiate a separate OEM/Embedded License Agreement);

   (d) Use the Software to develop a product or service that directly competes
   with Validibot's core functionality as a building simulation validation
   platform;

   (e) Share, publish, or disclose License Keys to any third party;

   (f) Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable laws or
   regulations; or

   (g) Circumvent or disable any license verification, usage tracking, or
   security features of the Software.

2.3 **Ownership.** The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor and its
licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software,
including all intellectual property rights therein. Licensee acknowledges that
the Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of
Licensor.

2.4 **Trademarks and Branding.** "Validibot", the Validibot logo, the Validibot
robot character, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos
used in connection with the Software (collectively, "Marks") are trademarks or
registered trademarks of Licensor. This Agreement does not grant Licensee any
right to use the Marks except as follows:

   (a) Licensee may use the Marks solely to identify that Licensee uses the
   Software, in a manner consistent with Licensor's trademark guidelines (if
   any) and in a way that does not suggest endorsement, sponsorship, or
   affiliation beyond the license relationship;

   (b) Licensee shall not use the Marks in any manner that disparages Licensor
   or the Software, or that dilutes, tarnishes, or brings into disrepute the
   Marks;

   (c) Licensee shall not register or attempt to register any trademark,
   domain name, or social media account that incorporates or is confusingly
   similar to any of the Marks; and

   (d) Licensee shall not remove, alter, or obscure any Marks appearing in
   the Software or Documentation.

All goodwill arising from use of the Marks inures solely to the benefit of
Licensor.

2.5 **Dual Licensing and Community Edition.** The Validibot Community Edition is
available under the AGPL-3.0 at https://github.com/danielmcquillen/validibot.
Purchasing a commercial license grants Licensee an alternative license for the
entire codebase (Community Edition plus Pro components), allowing Licensee to
use Validibot without any obligations of the AGPL-3.0. This means commercial
licensees can use the Community Edition code without sharing modifications, run
Validibot in proprietary environments without source disclosure, and combine
Validibot with proprietary software without AGPL copyleft requirements.

Nothing in this Agreement limits Licensee's rights under, or grants Licensee
rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable open source license for
third-party components included in the Software.

2.6 **Feedback.** If Licensee provides suggestions, enhancement requests, or
other feedback regarding the Software, Licensor may use such feedback without
restriction or obligation to Licensee.

## 3. SUBSCRIPTION AND PAYMENT

3.1 **Subscription Period.** This license is granted for the Subscription Period
specified in Licensee's Order Form. Unless terminated earlier in accordance
with this Agreement, the Subscription Period will automatically renew for
successive periods of the same duration unless either party provides written
notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the current
period.

3.2 **Subscription Fee.** Licensee agrees to pay the Subscription Fee as set
forth in the applicable Order Form. All fees are quoted and payable in
Australian Dollars (AUD) unless otherwise specified. Renewal fees may be
adjusted with at least sixty (60) days' notice before the renewal date.

unless otherwise agreed in writing. Late payments accrue interest at the rate
of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.

GST applies, Licensor will include GST on invoices and Licensee agrees to pay
such GST. Licensee is responsible for all other taxes, withholdings, duties,
and levies arising from the purchase (excluding taxes based on the net income
of Licensor).

3.5 **Refunds.** If the Software fails to perform substantially in accordance
with the Documentation within fourteen (14) days of initial delivery, and
Licensor is unable to remedy such failure within a reasonable time, Licensee
may request a full refund of Subscription Fees paid for the current period.
This is Licensee's sole remedy for non-conforming Software.

in writing. Support typically includes:

Features will be disabled upon expiration.

## 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

6.1 **AS IS.** THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,

(as provided by Licensor and used in accordance with this Agreement) infringes
any third-party copyright, patent, or trademark ("IP Claim"), and will pay any

(b) procure for Licensee the right to continue using the Software; or
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially practicable, terminate this
Agreement and refund to Licensee a pro-rata portion of any prepaid

warranty that the Software is free from security vulnerabilities, defects, or
errors. Licensee acknowledges that no software can be guaranteed to be
completely secure.

10.4 **Security Incident Notification.** If Licensor becomes aware of a security
vulnerability in the Software that may materially affect Licensee, Licensor will
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected Licensees and provide
remediation guidance. However, Licensor is not responsible for security
incidents arising from Licensee's infrastructure, configuration, customisations,
or failure to apply available patches.

responsibility or liability for, any data that Licensee or its users process,
store, or transmit using the Software.

data of Licensee's users. Licensee is the sole data controller for all data
processed through its installation of the Software.

11.2 **Telemetry and License Verification.** The Software may transmit limited
data to Licensor solely for the purposes of license verification and
anonymised usage statistics. Such data does not include Licensee's business
