### AGPL Requirements Summary

Under the AGPL-3.0, if you modify this software and make it available over a
network (e.g., as a web service), you must:

1. Make the complete source code of your modified version available to users
2. License your modifications under the AGPL-3.0
3. Preserve all copyright notices and license information

### When You Need a Commercial License

You need a Commercial License if you want to:

- Use Validibot in proprietary software without sharing your source code
- Distribute Validibot as part of a closed-source product
- Remove the network disclosure requirements of the AGPL
- Access Pro features (see https://validibot.com/pricing for details)
- Access Enterprise features (see https://validibot.com/pricing for details)

**Note on hosted/SaaS use:** The commercial license covers your own internal
use, including running Validibot as a service for your own organization's users.
If you want to offer Validibot as a hosted service to third parties (e.g., a
multi-tenant SaaS for external customers), you need a separate OEM/Embedded
license. Contact licensing@validibot.com for details.

**Note**: The Community edition includes ALL validators (including advanced validators
like EnergyPlus and FMI) and can be used with the CLI anywhere, including CI/CD
pipelines. Commercial tiers are primarily about removing AGPL obligations and
accessing team/organization features.
