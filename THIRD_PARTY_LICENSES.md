# Third-Party License Notices

Validibot is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only. This file documents third-party
dependencies that require explicit license choice or acknowledgement due to
copyleft, dual-license, or non-standard licensing terms.

All dependencies listed here have been reviewed and confirmed compatible with
AGPL-3.0.

Dependencies with standard permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0) that do
not offer a license choice are not listed individually. Their license texts are
included in the installed packages' `dist-info` directories in built artifacts
such as Docker images.
