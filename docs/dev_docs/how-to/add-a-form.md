# Adding or Updating Forms

When you introduce a new form or refactor an existing one, prefer Django Crispy
Forms for layout and rendering. It keeps markup consistent and reduces template
copy/paste. If you run into a case where Crispy is not viable, add a TODO note
in the relevant doc or issue so we can revisit.
