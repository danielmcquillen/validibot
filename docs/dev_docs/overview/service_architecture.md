# Service Layer Architecture

This document describes how the validation run service layer is decomposed into
focused modules, the rationale behind the structure, and how to extend it.

## Why We Split the Service

`ValidationRunService` started as a single class handling everything: run
lifecycle, step iteration, finding persistence, summary aggregation, step
dispatch, and cross-step value handling. At over 1200 lines it was becoming
difficult to reason about, test in isolation, and modify safely.

We decomposed it into four modules, each with a single responsibility:

```
ValidationRunService (facade)
├── launch()                        — create run, dispatch to worker
├── cancel_run()                    — cancel a pending/running run
├── execute_workflow_steps()        → StepOrchestrator
└── rebuild_run_summary_record()    → SummaryBuilder

StepOrchestrator
├── execute_workflow_steps()        — iterate steps sequentially
├── execute_workflow_step()         — dispatch single step to handler
├── _start_step_run()               — idempotent step creation
├── _finalize_step_run()            — persist status, duration, output
├── _record_step_result()           — persist findings (action steps only)
├── _execute_validator_step()       — call step processor
└── _resolve_run_actor()            — resolve the initiating user

RunContextBuilder
├── build()                         — compose the context for one step
├── build_upstream_steps()          — read canonical completed step values
└── _resolve_workflow_signals()     — resolve workflow-scoped signals

SummaryBuilder
├── rebuild_run_summary_record()    — idempotent public entry point
├── build_run_summary_record()      — aggregate from DB findings
└── extract_assertion_total()       — extract assertion count from stats

FindingsPersistence
├── normalize_issue()               — coerce raw issues to ValidationIssue
├── coerce_severity()               — map arbitrary severity to enum
├── severity_value()                — resolve string for DB storage
└── persist_findings()              — bulk-create ValidationFinding rows
```

## Design Principles

### Facade pattern preserves the public API

`ValidationRunService` remains the single import point for all callers. Views,
API endpoints, task queues, and callback handlers all continue to import from
`validations.services.validation_run`. The facade delegates to internal modules,
so no call sites need updating.

### Pure functions where possible

`FindingsPersistence` and `SummaryBuilder` expose standalone functions rather
than classes. They have no state, no side effects beyond database writes, and
are easy to test in isolation. The `StepOrchestrator` is a class because its
methods call each other and share the same execution context.

### Incremental extraction

Each module was extracted as a standalone step and tested before proceeding.
This minimises risk when refactoring a critical code path.

### One execution architecture

Validibot is pre-release, so the service does not carry runtime modes or legacy
readers. Every run uses durable attempt identity and canonical step-run values.
When an execution contract changes before public adoption, the application and
database migration move forward together instead of maintaining parallel
engines.

### Execution attempts identify concrete provider work

`ExecutionAttempt` is the durable identity for one concrete container or cloud
job launched for a `ValidationStepRun`. It records provider identity, attempt
number, runner and contract policy, exact bundle/envelope locations, image
identity, timeout, bounded diagnostics, and provider observations.

The database permits at most one non-terminal attempt per step and prevents two
rows from claiming the same provider execution within a runner/job namespace.
State changes go through `execution_attempts.py`, whose small monotonic graph
makes same-state delivery idempotent and prevents terminal attempts from
reopening. Every callback receipt has a required attempt reference.

## Module Responsibilities

### ValidationRunService (`validation_run.py`)

The public facade. Owns two web-layer operations:

- **`launch()`** — validates preconditions (permissions, limits), creates the
  `ValidationRun` record, and dispatches execution to the appropriate backend
  (Celery, Cloud Tasks, inline for tests).
- **`cancel_run()`** — transitions a pending/running run to CANCELED.

Everything else is delegated.

### StepOrchestrator (`step_orchestrator.py`)

The worker-side execution orchestrator. Handles:

- **State transitions**: PENDING to RUNNING (atomic, idempotent).
- **Step iteration**: Processes steps sequentially, stopping on failure or
  when an async validator returns pending.
- **Step dispatch**: Routes validator steps to the processor pattern and
  action steps to the handler registry.
- **Step lifecycle**: Creates step runs (idempotent via `get_or_create`),
  finalises them with status, duration, and diagnostics.
- **Result recording**: Persists findings, extracts signals for downstream
  assertions.
- **Run finalisation**: Sets terminal status, builds summary, logs tracking
  events, stamps the run `output_hash`, and triggers submission purge.

### SummaryBuilder (`summary_builder.py`)

Aggregates run-level and step-level summary records from persisted findings.
Queries the database rather than relying on in-memory metrics, making it safe
to call in resume scenarios (async callbacks, retries).

### FindingsPersistence (`findings_persistence.py`)

Handles the conversion of raw validation issues into normalised
`ValidationFinding` database records. Pure functions with no dependencies on
other service methods.

### Output Hash (`output_hash.py`)

Owns the tamper-evident run digest that is stamped after a run reaches a
terminal state. Community Validibot provides a built-in fallback contract, and
commercial packages can register one explicit provider when they need a
different canonical hash shape. This keeps the host application generic while
making the active Layer 3 hash contract explicit.

## Type-Safe Step Config

Each validator and action type stores different keys in `WorkflowStep.config`
(a JSONField). The `workflows/step_configs.py` module provides Pydantic models
that give these configs type safety:

```python
from validibot.workflows.step_configs import get_step_config

typed = get_step_config(step)
if isinstance(typed, EnergyPlusStepConfig):
    checks = typed.idf_checks  # list[str], type-checked
```

All models use `extra="allow"` so runtime-injected keys (like
`primary_file_uri` added during container launch) don't cause validation
errors.

The `WorkflowStep.typed_config` property provides convenient access:

```python
config = step.typed_config  # Returns the appropriate Pydantic model
```

Config validation also runs during `WorkflowStep.clean()`, catching type
mismatches at save time rather than at runtime.

### Available Config Models

| Validator / Action | Model | Key Fields |
|--------------------|-------|------------|
| JSON_SCHEMA | `JsonSchemaStepConfig` | `schema_source`, `schema_type`, `schema_text_preview` |
| XML_SCHEMA | `XmlSchemaStepConfig` | `schema_source`, `schema_type`, `schema_text_preview` |
| ENERGYPLUS | `EnergyPlusStepConfig` | `idf_checks`, `run_simulation`, `timestep_per_hour` (resource files stored via `WorkflowStepResource`) |
| AI_ASSIST | `AiAssistStepConfig` | `template`, `mode`, `cost_cap_cents`, `selectors`, `policy_rules` |
| BASIC | `BasicStepConfig` | (empty) |
| FMU | `FmuStepConfig` | (empty) |
| CUSTOM_VALIDATOR | `CustomValidatorStepConfig` | (empty) |
| SLACK_MESSAGE | `SlackActionStepConfig` | `message` |
| SIGNED_CREDENTIAL | `CredentialActionStepConfig` | (empty) |

### Adding a New Validator Type

1. Add the type to `ValidationType` in `validations/constants.py`.
2. Create a Pydantic model in `workflows/step_configs.py` extending
   `BaseStepConfig`.
3. Register it in the `STEP_CONFIG_MODELS` dict.
4. Create the validator class implementing `BaseValidator`.
5. Create a `ValidatorConfig` with `validator_class` pointing to your class
   (in the validator's `config.py` module).
6. Add `catalog_entries` to define the validator's step inputs and outputs.
   These appear automatically in the unified "Inputs and Outputs" card on the step detail page.
7. Run `python manage.py sync_validators` to sync to the database.
