## Organizations and access

- **Switch organizations**: Use the org picker in the header to change your current workspace. The help and workflow lists update to match.
- **Invite members**: Admins and Owners can invite users and assign roles (Owner, Admin, Author, Executor, Viewer).
- **Role basics**:
  - Owners/Admins: full management, including archiving workflows and editing validators.
  - Authors: create and edit workflows they own; can archive their own workflows.
  - Executors/Viewers: run or view workflows depending on role; cannot archive or delete.
- **Public info**: Some workflows expose a public info card; toggle visibility from the workflow detail if you have manage permissions.

Keep memberships active and scoped to the minimum role a user needs. Archive workflows instead of deleting when runs must remain for audit.
