## Getting started

Follow these steps to get up and running in a few minutes:

1. **Sign in and choose your org**: Use the org switcher in the header to make sure you are working in the right workspace.
2. **Create a workflow**: From the Workflows list, select **New Workflow**, add a name, project, and description.
3. **Add a step**: Click **Add step**, pick a validator, and confirm the submission type matches what your users will upload.
4. **Review default assertions**: Each validator ships with default assertions. Open **View rules** to see what will run automatically.
5. **Launch a test run**: Use **Launch** to upload a sample submission and confirm the results before sharing with others.

Tip: keep workflows active only when you are ready for runs; archive them instead of deleting if you need an audit trail.
