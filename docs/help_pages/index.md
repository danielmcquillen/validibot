## Validibot Community Help

This help center is tailored for the open source Community edition. It offers quick, task-focused answers while you work in the app.

Use these sections to jump straight to the topic you need:

- **Getting started** — sign in, pick your workspace, and create your first workflow.
- **Workflows** — add steps, pick validators, and manage archived items.
- **Validators** — understand built-in and custom validators plus their default assertions.
- **Concepts** — review the core objects and how they relate.
- **Workspace** — manage organizations, members, and roles.

For deeper background and design details, see the full user docs, but start here for quick reminders and UI guidance. When the commercial edition is enabled, additional help pages may appear for Pro features.
