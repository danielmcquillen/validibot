# Collaboration and Access

Use this page to walk through how teams share work inside SimpleValidations.

## Roles and Permissions
Summarize the OWNER, ADMIN, AUTHOR, and EXECUTOR roles. Add guidance for when to grant each role and how they relate to organizations, projects, and workflows.

## Inviting Teammates
Document the invitation flow, email notifications, and best practices for onboarding new members. Reserve space for noting how org/project context affects what people see after they join.

## Sharing Runs and Findings
Explain how to copy run links, export findings, or embed highlights in external tools. Mention any privacy toggles (like "make info public") that change what non-members can view.

## Notifications
Outline where notifications appear (in-app toasts, email digests, Slack actions) and how users can opt in/out. Leave placeholders for screenshots of notification settings.
