# Getting Started

This quick-start guide walks new Roscoe users through the first validation run.

1. **Create a workflow.** Use the *New Workflow* button and select a template that matches your file type.
2. **Invite teammates.** Share access with collaborators so they can review and rerun validations.
3. **Run a validation.** Upload a sample file or trigger the API to see Roscoe in action.
