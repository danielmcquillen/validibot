# SimpleValidations User Guide

Welcome to the SimpleValidations user documentation. These pages cover the everyday tasks for creating and running workflows,
interpreting validation results, and collaborating with your teammates.

## Quick start

1. [Sign up for SimpleValidations](https://app.simplevalidations.example/signup) or log into your existing workspace.
2. Create your first workflow from one of our templates.
3. Upload a file or trigger an integration to run validations (workflows can be paused and resumed from their detail page if you need to temporarily stop runs).

Use the navigation on the left to explore feature walkthroughs, tutorials, and FAQs tailored for end users.
