# Reviewing Results

Capture how reviewers interpret findings once a validation run finishes.

## Run Summary Panel
Document the status banner, timestamps, duration, and project badges. Describe which fields link back to submissions or workflows.

## Step-Level Details
Explain how to expand each workflow step, view validator notes, and download any artifacts. Include guidance for both automated validators and action steps (notifications, certificates, etc.).

## Findings and Severity
Outline the meaning of each severity level (info, warning, error) and how they relate to pass/fail outcomes. Provide space for examples that show how findings roll up to an overall decision.

## Sharing Outcomes
Describe the share links, export options, and any limitations around public info vs. internal results. Remind readers how permissions affect what teammates can see.
