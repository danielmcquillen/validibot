# Troubleshooting

Provide quick fixes for common issues users encounter.

## Workflow Creation Issues
Leave space to document slug conflicts, missing permissions, or validation errors that appear while saving workflows.

## Run Failures
Outline how to differentiate between validator failures, system errors, and permission problems. Suggest which logs or run IDs to capture before contacting support.

## API Errors
Reference the standard error response shape and explain how to interpret HTTP status codes vs. `code` values. Point to the Sending Data and Authentication guides for deeper dives.

## Performance or Queue Delays
Describe where to check queue depth, how to contact the support team, and what information (workflow ID, timestamps, payload size) helps diagnose delays.
