# Workflow Management

Use this outline to document how admins and authors keep workflows organized as their library grows.

## Plan Your Workflow Library
Explain how to decide between creating a brand-new workflow versus iterating on an existing version. Capture naming conventions, version numbers, and the org/project scoping rules that keep everything tidy.

## Create or Clone a Workflow
Step through the UI screens for making a workflow, including how to choose templates, configure steps, and assign the owning project. Leave space for screenshots or callouts that highlight the most important decisions.

## Edit Workflow Settings
Document each field in the workflow settings form (status, public info, featured images, etc.). Call out anything that requires specific permissions or has downstream effects like pausing runs.

## Maintain and Retire Workflows
Add guidance on when to lock a workflow, how to archive older versions, and what happens to existing runs when a workflow is disabled. Include any governance rules or review cadences that your team relies on.
