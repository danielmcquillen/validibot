            SimpleValidations is the developed by <a href="https://www.mcquilleninteractive.com"

            Daniel McQuillen.

          <p>
            I have spent the past two decades building practical software for research labs, building scientists, and
            educators who care about craft as much as they care about data accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea for SimpleValidations first took shape while creating a glazing system validation tool
            for the Windows and Daylighting Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Watching that tool save
            engineers hours of back-and-forth convinced me that smart, simple validation workflows could help any
            team that wrestles with complex data submissions.

            My goal is to give product teams, analysts, and domain experts a dependable co-pilot that makes data quality
            checks feel routine instead of punitive. SimpleValidations blends automated rules
            {% if ENABLE_AI_VALIDATIONS %}
              , AI-assisted review,
            {% endif %}
            and
            clear audit trails. SimpleValidations
            hides complex logic or simulations behind a simple interface so you and your users can validate data and documents
            with confidence and ease.

          <p>
            Whether I am helping an energy-efficiency researcher, a nonprofit educator, or a commercial product team,
            the same themes surface: people want software that respects their time, reflects their domain language, and
            keeps stakeholders aligned. SimpleValidations carries that ethos forward - crafting an opinionated, humane
            workflow so teams can trust their data, respond faster, and focus on the work only humans can do.

            I'm working with a select group of early users to make sure the system provides value
            and fits naturally into their workflows. If this all sounds interesting, I would love
            to hear how SimpleValidations can support you.
