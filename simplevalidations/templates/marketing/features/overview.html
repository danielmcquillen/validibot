            The basic premise behind SimpleValidations is simple: <mark>help your users validate their data.</mark>

        </p>

        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            You do this by building a validation workflow, composed of a series of discrete validation steps. You then provide that workflow to your users via the SimpleValidations API or
            the web interface.
          {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>

        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Your users can then invoke the validation workflow by sending it their data. SimpleValidations will run each defined validation
            step on the incoming data and report the results back to the user. If the validation has errors, the list of errors is shown.
            If it's successful, you can deliver a success message (complete with an official hash), a cryptographically signed certificate or
            even record the success event on a blockchain for full transparency.
          {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>

        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Automated validation workflows take you out of the loop and save you from the tedious parts of data validation.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If your users later need to provide
                this data to you, you know it's been validated according to your rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                If your users need to prove the data is valid to a third party, they can use the certificate
                SimpleValidations provided, or refer to a blockchain record SimpleValidations created.

          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Authoring validation workflows is easy via a simple user interface.
            You can use this interface to build up a series of validation steps, each with its own configuration.
            Validation steps can include JSON and XML schema checks, simulations, or custom validation logic.
          {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>

        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Organizations and projects keep users and workflows organized, so you can assign different workflows to different groups
            of users. Meanwhile, role-based permissions ensure owners, admins, executors, and viewers see just the right slice of the platform.

        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            A user triggers a run from their SimpleValidations dashboard, the REST API, or an integrations to GitHub. Submitted data is normalized,
            checksummed, and then queued with organization context so the execution layer can pick up the task and proceed.
          {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <p>
          {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Behind the scenes, asynchronous workers execute each step in order, capture findings, and emit notifications
            through email or webhooks so downstream systems can react immediately. The final status, including errors, is
            recorded in the database and returned to the user.

            Every validation run records the triggering user, workflow version, project, findings, and timestamps.
            Your SimpleValidations dashboards displays this data, showing trends across organizations so you can monitor throughput,
            error rates, and data quality in real time.

              SimpleValidations layers a Django control plane over an asynchronous execution fabric. The marketing site, app, and API all authenticate through the same organization-aware permissions model, while services route each step to the right validator—whether that is a JSON schema engine or a custom simulation.
