        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd (ABN #### )
          ("SimpleValidations," "we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards personal
          information in connection with the SimpleValidations software-as-a-service platform, websites,
          mobile applications, APIs, and related support services (collectively, the "Services"). We are

          visitors. Where our customers submit personal information to the Services, SimpleValidations acts as a
          "data processor" (or "service provider") on the customer's behalf. Customers remain
          responsible for obtaining the necessary rights to submit personal information to the Services.

          6. International Data Transfers
        </h2>
        <p>
          We host data primarily in Australia and the United States. If we transfer personal information
          across borders, including to countries that may not provide equivalent data protection, we will
          implement appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, intra-group agreements,
          or reliance on adequacy decisions. By using the Services, you authorise SimpleValidations to process and
          transfer personal information globally in accordance with this Policy.

          We retain personal information for as long as necessary to deliver the Services, comply with our
          legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Customer Data is retained in
          accordance with the applicable subscription plan and is deleted or anonymised within 30 days
          after termination unless we are legally required or permitted to retain it longer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          8. Security
        </h2>
        <p>
          We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal
          information against unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Measures
          include encryption in transit, role-based access controls, logging and monitoring, secure
          software development practices, regular vulnerability assessments, and incident response
          procedures. No system is fully secure; we encourage you to use strong passwords and enable
          multi-factor authentication where available.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          9. Your Rights
