        <p class="text-muted">

        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of the SimpleValidations
          platform, websites, mobile applications, application programming interfaces, and related
          services (collectively, the "Services") provided by McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd
          (ABC ### ) ("McQuillen Interactive," "we," "our," or "us"). By creating an account, executing an
          ordering document, or otherwise using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          If you are accessing the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent
          and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity and that "Customer," "you," and
          "your" refer to that entity.

          You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into binding contracts to
          use the Services. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and current registration
          information and to update it promptly. You are responsible for maintaining the security of

          immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          2. Ordering, Subscription Plans, and Fees
        </h2>
        <p>
          Access to the Services may require an executed order form, online checkout, or other written
          agreement that describes the applicable subscription plan, features, usage limits, fees, and
          term ("Order"). Unless otherwise stated in an Order: (a) fees are quoted and payable in
          Australian dollars; (b) fees are non-refundable; (c) subscriptions renew automatically for
          successive terms equal in length to the expiring term at our then-current rates unless either
          party gives written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the end of the current term;
          and (d) payment is due in advance of each billing period by the method selected at checkout.
          Late payments may accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount
          permitted by law. You are responsible for all taxes, duties, and governmental assessments
          associated with the Services, excluding taxes based on our net income.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          3. Acceptable Use
        </h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to (a) use the Services in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or third
          party right; (b) upload, transmit, or store malicious code; (c) interfere with or disrupt the
          integrity or performance of the Services; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to gain
          unauthorized access to the Services or related systems; (e) use the Services to develop a
          competing product; or (f) resell or sublicense the Services except as expressly authorized in an
          Order. We may suspend or terminate access to the Services for any violation of this section.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          4. Customer Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          "Customer Data" means data, content, and information submitted to the Services by or for you.
          You retain ownership of Customer Data. You grant McQuillen Interactive a worldwide, non-exclusive,
          royalty-free licence to host, copy, transmit, display, and process Customer Data solely as
          necessary to provide the Services, technical support, and related improvements. You are
          responsible for ensuring that Customer Data and your use of the Services comply with all
          laws, including privacy, data protection, and export control laws of Australia, the United
          States, and any jurisdiction in which you operate. You represent that you have obtained all
          rights and consents necessary for us to process Customer Data in accordance with these
          Terms. We will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures
          designed to protect Customer Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
          unauthorised disclosure, or access.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          5. Intellectual Property
        </h2>
        <p>
          McQuillen Interactive and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all
          related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to you other than those expressly set
          forth in these Terms. You grant McQuillen Interactive a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use
          and display your name, logos, and marks for the limited purpose of identifying you as a
          customer on our marketing materials; you may revoke this licence on written notice. If you
          provide feedback or suggestions regarding the Services, McQuillen Interactive may use the feedback without
          obligation or restriction.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          6. Confidentiality
        </h2>
        <p>
          Each party may receive or have access to confidential information of the other party. The
          receiving party will use confidential information only to perform its obligations under these
          Terms and will protect such information with at least the same degree of care as it uses to
          protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. Confidential
          information does not include information that is publicly available through no fault of the
          receiving party, already known to the receiving party without restriction, independently
          developed by the receiving party, or obtained legitimately from a third party without breach of
          confidentiality. The receiving party may disclose confidential information when required by law
          after providing reasonable notice and cooperating to seek protective treatment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          7. Privacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our handling of personal information is described in the SimpleValidations Privacy Policy,
          which is incorporated by reference. You agree that McQuillen Interactive may process personal information in
          accordance with the Privacy Policy and applicable law. When legally required, the parties will
          execute additional data protection terms, including standard contractual clauses for transfers of
          personal data outside Australia or the European Union, as applicable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          8. Third-Party Services
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services may interoperate with third-party products or services. McQuillen Interactive does not control
          and is not responsible for third-party services. Your use of third-party services is subject to
          that provider's terms and privacy policies. To the extent you enable a third-party integration,
          you authorise McQuillen Interactive to exchange Customer Data and account credentials with the third-party
          provider as required for the integration.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          9. Service Availability and Support
        </h2>
        <p>
          McQuillen Interactive will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available in accordance
          with any service level commitments set out in an Order. We may perform scheduled or
          emergency maintenance and will provide advance notice when practicable. Support levels are
          specified in your plan or Order. Beta features, preview releases, or evaluation access are
          provided "as is" with no warranty, support, or service level commitment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          10. Suspension and Termination
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services immediately if you materially breach
          these Terms (including non-payment) and fail to cure within 10 days after notice, or if your use
          poses a security risk, infringes intellectual property rights, or violates law. Either party may
          terminate these Terms for convenience at the end of any subscription term by providing written
          notice of non-renewal. Upon termination, you will promptly pay all outstanding amounts and we
          will make Customer Data available for export for 30 days, after which we may delete it unless
          legally prohibited. Provisions intended to survive (including Sections 3 through 19) will remain
          in effect.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          11. Warranties and Disclaimers
        </h2>
        <p>
          McQuillen Interactive warrants that it will provide the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner
          consistent with generally accepted industry standards. To the maximum extent permitted by
          law, McQuillen Interactive disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including any warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, system
          integration, or availability. The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis and
          may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of the internet and
          electronic communications. Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory consumer guarantees
          that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          12. Limitation of Liability
        </h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable for any indirect, incidental,
          special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue,
          data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to these Terms, even if advised of the possibility of
          such damages. McQuillen Interactive's aggregate liability arising from or relating to the Services will not
          exceed the amounts paid or payable by you to McQuillen Interactive in the 12 months immediately preceding
          the event giving rise to liability. The limitations in this section do not apply to your payment
          obligations or to either party's liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence,
          fraud, wilful misconduct, or any liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          13. Indemnification
        </h2>
        <p>
          McQuillen Interactive will defend and indemnify you against third-party claims alleging that your authorised
          use of the Services infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of that third
          party, and will pay any damages or costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or
          agreed in settlement. This obligation does not apply to claims arising from (a) Customer Data;
          (b) combination of the Services with products or services not provided by McQuillen Interactive; (c) use of the
          Services in breach of these Terms; or (d) a modification of the Services not made by McQuillen Interactive.
          You will defend and indemnify McQuillen Interactive against third-party claims arising from Customer Data or
          your violation of law or these Terms. The indemnified party must provide prompt notice of the
          claim, reasonable cooperation, and sole control of the defence, except that consent is required
          for any settlement imposing monetary or injunctive obligations on the indemnified party.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          14. Compliance and Export Control
        </h2>
        <p>
          You represent that you and your affiliates are not located in, under the control of, or a national
          or resident of any country or jurisdiction subject to Australian, U.S., or other applicable trade
          sanctions. You will not access or use the Services in violation of export, import, or economic
          sanctions laws. You are responsible for complying with all applicable anti-corruption, anti-
          bribery, and data localisation laws.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          15. Publicity and References
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unless you opt out by written notice, McQuillen Interactive may identify you as a customer in proposals, case
          studies, investor materials, and other marketing collateral. Any opt-out will not affect prior
          publicity already in use.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          16. Notices
        </h2>
        <p>
          Notices to McQuillen Interactive must be sent to legal@simplevalidations.com and to McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd,
          Unit 7, 3 Bolinda Street, Bentleigh, Victoria, Australia 3204. Notices to you may be sent to the
          email or physical address in your account or Order. Notices are deemed given when received,
          or for email, when sent if no bounce-back is received.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          17. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia, without regard to conflict
          of laws principles. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New
          South Wales for any dispute arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Services. The United
          Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. Each party
          waives the right to participate in class or representative actions to the extent permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          18. Force Majeure
        </h2>
        <p>
          Neither party is liable for delay or failure to perform resulting from causes beyond its
          reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, labour disputes,
          internet or telecommunication failures, governmental acts, or power outages, provided the
          affected party uses commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          19. General
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any Orders, constitute the entire agreement
          between the parties regarding the Services and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.
          If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Neither
          party may assign these Terms without the other party's prior written consent, except that McQuillen Interactive
          may assign to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. Failure
          to enforce a provision is not a waiver. The parties are independent contractors; nothing herein
          creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship. Headings are for convenience only.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5">
