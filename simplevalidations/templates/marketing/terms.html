          These Terms of Service ("Terms") describe the limited, early access to the SimpleValidations
          services and websites (the "Services") operated by McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd ("McQuillen
          Interactive", "we", or "us"). By using the Services, you confirm that you accept these Terms.
          If you are using the Services on behalf of an organisation, you confirm you can bind that organisation.

        <p>
          The Services are currently provided without charge and without production support while we

          time without notice.

          You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts. Access is by

          2. Acceptable Use

        <p>
          You agree to use the Services lawfully and responsibly. Do not interfere with the operation of

        <p>
          You retain ownership of content you submit ("Customer Data") and grant us a licence to host and
          process Customer Data to operate and improve the Services. Do not upload confidential, personal,
          or sensitive information while the Services are in early access. You are responsible for ensuring
          that your use is lawful in every jurisdiction in which you operate.

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          5. No Professional Advice
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services and any outputs are for general informational purposes, are not guaranteed to be
          accurate, and do not constitute professional advice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          6. Warranties and Availability
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind,
          whether express, implied, or statutory. We do not guarantee uptime, data retention, or that the
          Services will be error-free.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          7. Limitation of Liability
        </h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental,
          consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          8. Australian Consumer Law
        </h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantees, rights, or
          remedies you may have under the Australian Consumer Law. Where legislation allows us to limit
          our liability, and the Services are supplied for business purposes, our responsibility is limited
          at our option to resupplying the Services or refunding any amounts you paid for the relevant
          Service period.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. Both parties submit to the
          non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria and the Commonwealth of Australia. If you
          access the Services from another jurisdiction, you are responsible for compliance with your local
          laws.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          10. Changes to These Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Services after an update
          means you accept the revised Terms.
        </p>
