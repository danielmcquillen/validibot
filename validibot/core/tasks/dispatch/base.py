"""
Base class for task dispatchers.

This module defines the abstract interface that all task dispatchers must implement.
The interface supports multiple deployment targets for enqueueing validation work.

## Design Principles

1. **Encapsulate dispatch mechanism**: Dispatchers handle the full lifecycle of
   creating and submitting tasks. Callers don't need to know implementation details.

2. **Clear sync vs async distinction**: Some dispatchers (test, local dev) run
   tasks synchronously, while others (Celery, Cloud Tasks) are truly async.

3. **Platform-agnostic**: Each dispatcher uses its own task queue mechanism
   internally. The interface works with simple request objects.

4. **Follows existing patterns**: Mirrors the ExecutionBackend pattern in
   validations/services/execution/ for consistency.

    Abstract base class for task dispatchers.

    A task dispatcher handles enqueueing validation run tasks to the appropriate

    - Test: synchronous inline execution
    - Local dev: direct HTTP call to worker
    - Docker Compose: Celery with Redis broker
    - Google Cloud: Cloud Tasks queue
    - AWS: TBD (SQS, Step Functions, etc.)

    ## Implementation Notes

    Subclasses must implement:
    - `dispatcher_name`: Human-readable name
    - `is_sync`: Property indicating if execution is synchronous
    - `dispatch()`: Main dispatch method
    - `is_available()`: Check if dispatcher is ready

    The dispatch() method should not raise exceptions for transient failures;
    instead, return a TaskDispatchResponse with the error field set.
