            Validibot is developed by <a href="https://www.mcquilleninteractive.com"
    rel="noopener"
    target="_blank">McQuillen Interactive</a>, a Melbourne-based web application studio founded by
            Daniel McQuillen.
            I've been building practical software for research labs, building scientists, and
            educators for more than two decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea for Validibot first took shape while creating a glazing system validation tool
            for the Windows and Daylighting Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Watching that tool save
            engineers hours of back-and-forth convinced me that smart, simple validation workflows could help any
            team that wrestles with complex data submissions.

            My goal is to give product teams, analysts, and domain experts a dependable service that makes data quality
            checks feel routine and helpful instead of tedious and draining.

            Validibot blends automated validation rules

              , AI-assisted review,
            {% endif %}
            and clear audit trails. It hides complex logic or custom simulations behind a simple interface,
            so you and your users can validate data with confidence and ease.

          <p>
            Whether I am helping a building energy-efficiency researcher, a nonprofit educator, or a commercial product team,
            the same themes surface: people want software that respects their time, is easy to use, and
            keeps stakeholders aligned. Validibot carries that ethos forward, allowing authors to craft clear and orderly 
            workflows so teams can validate and trust their data, respond faster, and focus on what matters most to their organization.

            I'm working with a select group of early users to make sure the system provides value
            and fits naturally into their workflows. If this all sounds interesting, I would love
            to hear how Validibot can support you.
