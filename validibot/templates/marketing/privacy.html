          This Privacy Policy describes how McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd ABN 77 605 496 268
          ("Validibot", "we", "our", or "us") handles personal information when you use
          the Validibot services, websites, and applications (collectively, the "Services").
          We are an Australian company and store all primary data on infrastructure located
          in Australia.

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          1. Scope and Responsibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          Validibot acts as the data controller for information we collect through the Services.
          When we process Customer Data (as defined in our Terms of Service) on behalf of our
          customers, we do so as a data processor solely under the customer's instructions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          2. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account information.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your
            email address, name, and authentication credentials. If you sign up via Google OAuth,
            we receive your basic profile information from Google.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment information.</strong> When you subscribe to a paid plan, our payment
            processor Stripe collects your payment card details, billing address, and related
            information. We do not store complete card numbers on our servers; we receive only
            a masked card reference and billing details from Stripe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Customer Data.</strong> Files you upload and data you submit for validation,

          or in connection with a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition.
          Each provider is bound by agreements that limit their use of the data to what is
          necessary to support us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          5. Data Location and Transfers

        <p>
          Our primary application database, file storage, and compute infrastructure are

          that agree to safeguard the information we share with them.
        </p>

          6. Data Retention

          except where we are required to retain it for legal, accounting, or fraud prevention
          purposes.
