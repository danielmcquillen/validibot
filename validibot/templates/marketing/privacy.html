          Effective date: 1 July 2025

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd ("Validibot", "we", "our", or "us")
          handles personal information when you visit our marketing site or request early access to the
          Validibot beta (collectively, the "Services"). We run a small, invite-only Django application and
          collect only the data necessary to operate the waitlist and keep the site secure.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          1. Scope and Responsibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          Validibot acts as the data controller for information we collect through the marketing site and
          beta waitlist. If we process personal information for a customer in the future, we will do so solely under
          that customer's instructions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          2. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Waitlist signups.</strong> When you submit the beta waitlist form we collect your email address and
            store technical context captured automatically by the form, including the section of the site you used,
            referral URL, user agent, IP address, and timestamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communications.</strong> Messages you send to <a href="mailto:daniel@validibot.com">daniel@validibot.com</a>
            along with any information you choose to include.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operational logs.</strong> Heroku, our hosting provider, records device information, IP addresses, URLs
            requested, and error details in rotating application logs to help us troubleshoot issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics.</strong> We use PostHog Cloud EU to understand aggregated website usage. PostHog sets
            first-party cookies or local storage identifiers and receives usage metadata (such as page views,
            approximate location derived from IP address, and device type). PostHog operates on infrastructure
            located in the European Union.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          3. How We Use Information
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Manage the beta waitlist, including sending welcome emails and product updates;
          </li>
          <li>
            Operate, monitor, and secure the Services, including analysing performance and preventing abuse;
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          4. How We Share Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal information. We share information only with trusted service providers that
          help us deliver the Services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hosting.</strong> Heroku (Salesforce, Inc.) provides infrastructure and log aggregation for the
            marketing site and beta waitlist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email delivery.</strong> Postmark (Wildbit LLC) sends transactional messages such as beta welcome emails on our behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics.</strong> PostHog Cloud EU (PostHog, Inc.) processes pseudonymised usage data under our instructions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect rights or safety, or in connection with a
          business transaction. Each provider is bound by agreements that limit their use of the data to what is
          necessary to support us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          5. Data Retention
        </h2>
        <p>
          We retain waitlist records and related metadata until you ask us to delete them or until we no longer
          need the information to operate the beta programme. Operational logs rotate automatically and are kept for
          a short period consistent with Heroku's default retention. Analytics data is aggregated and retained by
          PostHog according to its EU service commitments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          6. Security
        </h2>
        <p>
          We limit access to waitlist data to the small Validibot team, enforce authentication on the admin,
          and rely on Heroku's managed security controls (including encryption in transit and at rest). No internet
          service can be completely secure, so please use a strong, unique email account password.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          7. Your Rights and Choices
        </h2>
        <p>
          You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by emailing
          <a href="mailto:privacy@validibot.com">privacy@validibot.com</a>. You can unsubscribe from waitlist emails at any time using the
          link in the message or by contacting us directly. Depending on your location, you may also have rights to
          object to or restrict certain processing, or to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          8. Australian Privacy Obligations
        </h2>
        <p>
          We comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles when handling
          personal information. That includes taking reasonable steps to inform you why we collect data,
          keeping it secure, and allowing access or correction on request. Our core application runs on
          Heroku infrastructure located in the United States, and analytics data is processed by PostHog in
          the European Union; by using the Services you consent to these overseas disclosures. We only work
          with providers that agree to safeguard the information we share with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have concerns about our handling of personal information, contact us first so we can work to
          resolve the issue. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Office of the Australian
          Information Commissioner (OAIC) at <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/">https://www.oaic.gov.au/</a> or by
          calling 1300 363 992.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          9. Cookies and Analytics Controls
        </h2>
        <p>
          PostHog uses first-party cookies or browser storage to measure how visitors engage with the marketing site.
          These cookies do not power advertising or track you across unrelated sites. You can block or delete cookies
          through your browser settings or contact us to opt out of analytics for your device.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          10. Children's Privacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
          children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will delete it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          11. Changes to This Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will post an update on
          this page and adjust the effective date. Your continued use of the Services after the changes take effect
          means you accept the revised Policy.
        </p>
