          <strong>Alpha Release Notice:</strong> Validibot is currently in alpha. The Services are
          under active development and may contain bugs, errors, or incomplete features. By using

        </div>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Validibot
          services, websites, and applications (the "Services") operated by McQuillen Interactive Pty Ltd
          ABN 77 605 496 268 ("McQuillen Interactive", "we", or "us"). By using the Services, you confirm

          1. Alpha Status and Service Availability
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services are provided as an "alpha" release. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Features may change, be removed, or behave unexpectedly without notice;</li>
          <li>Data loss may occur despite our reasonable efforts to prevent it;</li>
          <li>Service interruptions and downtime should be expected;</li>
          <li>We may reset, migrate, or modify data structures as the product evolves;</li>
          <li>Support is provided on a best-efforts basis only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We strongly recommend that you do not rely on the Services for critical business processes
          during the alpha period. Always maintain independent backups of any important data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          2. Eligibility and Access
        </h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts. During alpha,
          access may be by invitation only, and we may limit, suspend, or revoke access at our discretion
          without liability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          3. Subscription and Billing
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Trial Period.</strong> New accounts receive a 14-day free trial. During the trial, you
          have access to the Starter plan features. No payment is required until the trial ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subscription Plans.</strong> After your trial, you must subscribe to a paid plan to
          continue using the Services. Subscription fees are billed monthly in advance through our
          payment processor, Stripe. Prices are displayed in Australian Dollars (AUD) and include GST
          where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your
          account settings or by contacting support. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your
          current billing period. You will retain access until then.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> Given the alpha nature of the Services, we offer a generous refund
          policy. If you are dissatisfied for any reason within 30 days of a payment, contact
          <a href="mailto:support@validibot.com">support@validibot.com</a> and we will provide a full
          refund. After 30 days, refunds are at our discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change subscription prices with 30 days' notice.
          Price changes do not affect your current billing period.

          <strong>Alpha Caution:</strong> During alpha, we recommend against uploading highly sensitive,

          7. No Professional Advice
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Services provide data validation tools for building energy models and related technical
          data. Outputs are for informational purposes only, are not guaranteed to be accurate or
          complete, and do not constitute professional engineering, architectural, or compliance advice.
          You remain solely responsible for verifying outputs and making decisions based on them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          8. Warranties and Disclaimer
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties
          of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.</strong> We specifically disclaim any
          implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of
          viruses or other harmful components. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or
          reliability of any validation results or outputs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          9. Limitation of Liability
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or
            punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill,
            or business opportunities;
          </li>
          <li>
            We are not liable for any damages arising from your reliance on validation results or
            outputs from the Services;
          </li>
          <li>
            Our total aggregate liability for all claims arising from or related to these Terms or
            the Services shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid us in the 12 months
            preceding the claim, or (b) AUD $100.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These limitations apply regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, strict liability,
          or otherwise) and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          10. Indemnification
        </h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless McQuillen Interactive and its officers, directors,
          employees, and agents from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including
          legal fees) arising from your use of the Services, your violation of these Terms, or your
          violation of any third-party rights.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          11. Australian Consumer Law
        </h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantees, rights, or
          remedies you may have under the Australian Consumer Law that cannot be excluded by agreement.
          Where the Australian Consumer Law permits us to limit our liability, and the Services are
          acquired for business purposes (not as a consumer), our liability is limited at our option to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resupplying the Services; or</li>
          <li>Refunding any amounts you paid for the relevant service period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          12. Termination
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services immediately if you breach these Terms,
          if required by law, or if we discontinue the Services. Upon termination, your right to use the
          Services ceases immediately. We will make reasonable efforts to allow you to export your data
          before termination, except in cases of serious breach.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. Both parties submit to the
          non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria and the Federal Court of Australia.
          If you access the Services from another jurisdiction, you are responsible for compliance
          with your local laws.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          14. Changes to These Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by email
          or by posting a notice in the Services. Continued use of the Services after changes take
          effect means you accept the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you should
          stop using the Services and cancel your subscription.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-5">
          15. General
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and McQuillen Interactive regarding
          the Services. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in
          full force. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of that provision. You may
          not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms without our consent.
        </p>
